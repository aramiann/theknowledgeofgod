                                                        This book is written to refresh the life of the soul. Its prime
                                                        purpose is to advance
                                                        the "knowledge of God," so that we may know our Creator as He
                                                        really is, not as
                                                        we may wish Him to be!

                                                        A poet once said: "God is closer to me than I am to myself. Why,
                                                        then, am I so far
                                                        from Him?" How can this be possible? The distance between our
                                                        spirit and the Spirit
                                                        of God can be measured by the difference between God as He
                                                        really is, and the God
                                                        that we have created in our mind. The purpose of acquiring the
                                                        "knowledge of God"
                                                        is to diminish the distance. The more we know God as He really
                                                        is, the closer we
                                                        draw to Him.

                                                        created and designed

                                                        advance spiritually
                                                        by remaining in touch with our Designer. Our welfare and our
                                                        destiny depend on harmonizing
                                                        our life with what He has planned and has in store for us.
                                                        Unless we accept and
                                                        submit to His plan, we cannot manifest our full potential, nor

                                                        is hidden in these questions: Why do people deny their Redeemers
                                                        when they

                                                        only a few followers, and then welcome them when they have many
                                                        followers?
                                                        Why do
                                                        they first persecute their Prophets and Saviors, and centuries

                                                        Bahá’u’lláh wrote an Epistle—called The Most Holy Tablet—to
                                                        Christians. It

                                                        His strongest and most urgent appeals to Christians to

                                                        meaning.
                                                        Allow your “spiritual instinct” to respond. Let your soul bask

                                                        This volume represents the fifth stage of our search into the
                                                        claim of the

                                                        and Bahá'u'lláh. Although it can and does serve as proof, its
                                                        chief function
                                                        is to remove the obstacles that
                                                        stand in the way of proofs, to disperse the clouds of
                                                        misconceptions that
                                                        obscure the light of truth.
                                                        Specifically, it seeks to decode the language of Scriptural
                                                        symbolism on the
                                                        return of Jesus, to demonstrate
                                                        how the symbolic words have always stood as obstacles in the
                                                        path of the
                                                        search for Truth, depriving the
                                                        masses of mankind from recognizing the Divine Messengers.

                                                        Should religion be acknowledged merely on faith? Is religion

                                                        For the divine Educators teach otherwise; they ask us to search

                                                        Every seeker of truth needs to know why he believes in his own
                                                        Faith, his
                                                        own Savior. Once this is accomplished, the task of seeking and
                                                        finding the
                                                        truth becomes quite simple. All that the seeker needs to do is
                                                        to apply the
                                                        conditions or requirements that hold true in relation to his own
                                                        Faith and
                                                        Savior, to the new Faith and the new Savior. If they apply, he
                                                        accepts; if
                                                        not, he rejects.

                                                        expanding at an ever-increasing pace. What is this Order?

                                                        help you find those verses. Read all the quotations once,
                                                        and mark the
